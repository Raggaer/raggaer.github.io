<span>evm</span></div><p>Custom NFT Collection that uses raw bytecode smart-contracts
for storing SVG data directly on chain instead of using IPFS or storing the SVG data on the main contract itself.
Generating custom smart-contract bytecode in Go.</p><p>This implementation allows to save gas when deploying the collection contract since it does not carry any SVG data,
instead the data is deployed separately on a different contract, however this contract uses custom bytecode to
reduce any uneeeded data, saving gas on the deployment.</p></div><div class=project><h2><a href=https://github.com/Raggaer/create2-payment-gateway rel=noopener target=_blank>CREATE2 Payment Gateway</a></h2><h3>Personal Project</h3><div class=tags><span>blockchain</span>

<span>go</span>
<span>evm</span></div><p>Proof of concept for a payment gateway using the CREATE2 opcode.
The payment gateway allows the user to pay for a service using a smart-contract address that does not exist yet.
When the user pays for the service, the payment gateway deploys the service contract using the CREATE2 opcode,
the deployed contract address is deterministic and can be calculated before the contract is deployed.</p><p>The contract implements a drain like functionality, draining everything when deployed and any future payment to that address.
This implementation allows to save gas since the contract is only deployed when the user pays for the service.
Also it does not have to deal with any account or key management since the contract is deployed by the payment gateway.</p></div><div class=project><h2><a href=https://github.com/Raggaer/SimpleMixer rel=noopener target=_blank>SimpleMixer</a></h2><h3>Masters Thesis, Personal Project</h3><div class=tags><span>blockchain</span>

Using ECDSA signatures generated by a central server used to validate withdraws.
All generated signatures follow the EIP-712 schema.</p><p>The mixer approach implements signature checking on the smart-contract side (using ecrecover to get the public key of the signature), allowing the user to withdraw
only when the signature was provided by the authorized server.

Allows the user to create custom controller logic by using Lua scripts.
Bringing the power of Lua to the web with the speed of Go.</p><p>The application starts a pool of Lua VMs that are used to execute the controller logic for each request that comes in.
A small standard library was created to allow the user to interact with the application, including: database access, session management, request handling, form manipulation, etc.</p></div><div class=project><h2><a href=https://github.com/Raggaer/bison>bison</a></h2><h3>Personal Project</h3><div class=tags><span>lua</span>

However this framework is for general purpose websites, not only for OpenTibia servers.</p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
